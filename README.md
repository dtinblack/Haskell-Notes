## Haskell Notes

### Introduction

The following are a series of notes that have been compiled during my self study for the functional programming language [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/). The sources for the material are books, web sites, videos and papers. The notes are supported by Haskell programs to emphasis the concepts that have been explored.

[Point-free Style](/Point-free_Style) - a function can be defined without reference to one or more of its arguments which enables clear and concise code to be written.

[Infix_Operators](/Infix_Operators) - infix operators cover two aspects: <i>precedence</i> which is the order which an operator is applied, and <i>associativity</i> which is a property that determines how operators of the same precedence are grouped in the absence of parentheses.

#### Books

[Programming in Haskell](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Programming_in_Haskell.html?id=75C5DAAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y) - a clearly written book with exercises at the end of each chapter that reinforce the learning. I found this an ideal beginners book and remains my 'go to' reference book when I come across ideas that are new to me.

 [Introduction to Functional Programming Using Haskell](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Introduction-Functional-Programming-International-Computing/dp/0134841891/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1545323487&sr=1-1&keywords=9780134841892) - more detailed chapters, for example on data structures, than the book above. It includes technical detail behind Haskell.

[Introduction to Functional Programming Systems Using Haskell](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OPFoJZeI8MEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Introduction+to+Functional+Programming+Systems+Using+Haskell&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiW8Iv56K7fAhX9UhUIHZEnBVAQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=Introduction%20to%20Functional%20Programming%20Systems%20Using%20Haskell&f=false) - goes into the nuts and bolts of Haskell and covers topics such as Lambda Calculus, SKI Combinators and Type Inference. It also includes a list of papers that were the source for Haskell.
